        <h2>Why Test Is Important?</h2>
        <p>
          IQ tests are considered important for several reasons: Assessment of
          Cognitive Abilities: IQ tests provide a way to assess an individual's
          cognitive abilities, such as problem-solving, logical reasoning,
          memory, and mathematical skills.
          <br />
          <br />

          This information can be useful for understanding a person's
          intellectual strengths and weaknesses. Educational Placement:IQ tests
          are often used in educational settings to help determine the most
          appropriate educational placement for a student. For example, they can
          assist in identifying gifted students who may benefit from advanced
          coursework or students who may need additional support. Clinical and
          Psychological Assessment:In clinical psychology, IQ tests are used to
          assess cognitive functioning and potential intellectual disabilities.
          They can be part of a broader assessment to diagnose conditions like
          intellectual disability, ADHD, or learning disorders. Job Selection
          and Career Planning:Some employers use IQ tests as part of their
          hiring process to assess a candidate's problem-solving and analytical
          skills.
          <br />
          <br />
          It can also help individuals make informed career choices based on
          their cognitive strengths.

        />
        <p>
          An IQ, or Intelligence Quotient, is a numerical score that is supposed
          to measure a person's cognitive abilities and general intelligence.
          It's typically assessed through standardized tests that evaluate
          various aspects of intellectual functioning, such as problem-solving,
          reasoning, memory, and knowledge. However, IQ tests have their
          limitations and don't capture the full scope of human intelligence or
          potential. They are often controversial and should be interpreted with
          caution.
